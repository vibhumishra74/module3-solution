                    Don't bother typing “lorem ipsum” into Google translate. 
                    If you already tried, you may have gotten anything from
                     "NATO" to "China", depending on how you capitalized the
                      letters. The bizarre translation was fodder for
                       conspiracy theories, but Google has since updated
                        its “lorem ipsum” translation to, boringly enough,
                         “lorem ipsum”.
